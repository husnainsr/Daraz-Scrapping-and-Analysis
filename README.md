This project provides a collection of Python scripts for scraping and analyzing e-commerce data for online sellers. The project includes two main modules: one for scraping product reviews from e-commerce websites, and another for analyzing seller data on Daraz.

### Product Reviews Scraper

The product reviews scraper module allows users to scrape three pages of reviews for a single product listing using the product URL. The code is generic and works for every product listing URL, with proper checks in place. The output includes the name of the product, its actual and discounted prices, discount percentage, rating, number of reviews, and top three reviews displayed.
